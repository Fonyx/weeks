![Screenshot](https://github.com/Fonyx/weeks/blob/main/Assets/screenshots/screenshot.PNG?raw=true "Weeks of Life")  

A little js exercise that shows you how many weeks you have lived based on your life expectancy

data was sourced from https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy

all assumptions in the background:  
    - assuming Australia is country of query  
    - life expectancy is set to lower bound, i.e life expectancy at year of birth, ignores that life expectancy increases through lifetime. So this is a <bold>LOWEST ESTIMATE</bold>
